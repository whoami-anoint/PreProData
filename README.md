# PreProData: Data Preprocessing Library


 " `Pre Processing Data:` PreProData" a versatile and user-friendly package for data preprocessing, catering to various data analysis and machine learning needs.

PreProData is a Python library designed to simplify data preprocessing tasks, including data cleaning and feature scaling. It provides easy-to-use functions for enhancing the quality of your data before analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Installation

You can install PreProData using pip:

```bash
pip install PreProData
```

## Usage
You can customize this given sample template/example according to your specific dataset and preprocessing needs. "PreProData" package provides the necessary functions to perform these common data preprocessing tasks efficiently.

```python
import pandas as pd
from preprodata import remove_duplicates, scale_features

try:
    # Load your dataset using the full file path, treating all columns as strings
    data = pd.read_csv('sample.csv', dtype=str)

    # Clean the data by removing duplicate rows
    cleaned_data = remove_duplicates(data)

    # Preprocess the data by scaling numeric features
    # Assuming that your scale_features function handles strings gracefully
    scaled_data = scale_features(cleaned_data)

    # Now you can work with the cleaned and scaled data
    print(scaled_data.head())  # Example: Display the first few rows of the processed data

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File 'sample.csv' not found. Make sure the file path is correct.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
